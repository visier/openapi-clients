      summary: Retrieve a list of sources
      description: |-
        Prior to transferring data to Visier, you must identify the sources you want to target. Sources store data for
         the solution and are used to map data to Visier's data model.

         Note: To set up sources in your tenant, contact Visier Customer Success.
         This API allows you to query the list of available sources, and identify the source schema and required fields.

        Use this API to start a new transfer session. A transfer session can include one or more batches of records to be
         sent to Visier. Batches of records may be transferred as JSON or file payloads.

         Recommended: For optimal performance, please include all batches of records in a single transfer session.

      summary: Transfer data to sources via JSON
      description: |-
        This API allows you to transfer data to Visier in batches of records. Each request includes a batch of records
         formatted as a comma separated array with the first row containing the column headers in the request body. Each
         subsequent request should also include the first row as a header.

         Each request transfers a batch of records to a single source. Transfer sessions may include one or more batches before completion.

         Each batch is identified by a sequence number. Sequence numbers help identify any batches  that were delivered incorrectly.

         Each batch is limited to the following request size:
         - Batch size limit: 10 MB
         - Record count limit: 300,000 rows

        This API allows you to cancel a transfer session after starting it. If a transfer session is cancelled, all
         records within the transfer session do not persist in Visierâ€™s data store.

         If you cancel a transfer session, please start a new transfer session and resend the complete data set.

         You might cancel a transfer session if:
         - A request to send a batch of records failed.
         - The original set of records is incomplete.
         - An infrastructure error occurs.

      summary: Transfer data to sources via file upload
      description: |-
        This API allows you to upload data to Visier as CSV or ZIP files. Each request transfers a single file. If the
         data intended for Visier is stored in multiple files, you may compress them into a single ZIP file or make
         multiple requests within the same transfer session.

         File size limit: 3 GB

         Each file is identified by a sequence number. Sequence numbers help identify any batches that were delivered incorrectly.

         If you define a specific source in the request, all files within the request will target the declared source. If
         a source is not defined, the filenames are matched against the source regex to correctly assign each file to a
         source. To find out the source regex, please contact Visier Customer Success.

         Note: If you include files that should target multiple sources in one ZIP file, do not define a source in the request.

         Analytic tenants: For optimal transfer speed, provide one ZIP file per source.
         Administrating tenants: For optimal transfer speed, provide one ZIP file containing all the required data files for your analytic tenants.
         In the ZIP file, use one folder per analytic tenant. The ZIP file must adhere to the following file structure:

         File1.zip
         - Folder1: WFF_tenantCode1
            - Filename1.csv

         Processing jobs deal with an individual analytic tenant's data load. A processing job is either triggered through
         the UI or is one of many processing jobs spawned from a receiving job. When a processing job is triggered as part
         of a set from an receiving job, it is associated to the receiving job through a Parent ID.
