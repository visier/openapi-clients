  title: Visier Administration APIs
  description: Visier APIs for managing your tenant or tenants in Visier. You can programmatically manage user accounts in Visier, the profiles and permissions assigned to users, and to make changes in projects and publish projects to production. Administrating tenant users can use administration APIs to manage their analytic tenants and consolidated analytics tenants.<br>**Note:** If you submit API requests for changes that cause a project to publish to production (such as assigning permissions to users or updating permissions), each request is individually published to production, resulting in hundreds or thousands of production versions. We recommend that you use the `ProjectID` request header to make changes in a project, if `ProjectID` is available for the API endpoint.

      summary: Add an analytic tenant
      description: |-
        Prior to processing and loading an analytic tenant's data files, you must provision, or create, that tenant.
         A provisioned analytic tenant is automatically enabled. If the tenant's data is loaded after provisioning, that
         data is immediately accessible by their users.

         Create an analytic tenant and identify the applications assigned to the tenant. Visier
         organizes content under a set of modules.

         Contact Visier Support to determine the list of modules allocated to you.

      description: |-
        You may need to update analytic tenants as they grow and as your organization upgrades the content available to
         them. You may also encounter a scenario where an analytic tenant transitions across different industries.

         To ensure that the analytic tenant receives accurate benchmarks and predictive functionality, update their
         industry code in the Visier system.

         You can use this API to update any field on an analytic tenant, except `tenantCode`.

        Warning! Deprovisioning an analytic tenant is not reversible.
         Before deprovisioning, you must disable an analytic tenant. For more information, see **`/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/disable`**.

         This API removes an analytic tenant permanently from the Visier system. If you are unsure whether an analytic tenant
         may be re-enabled on any of the Visier modules at any time, you may instead want to disable the analytic tenant.

         If successful, the response returns the status "Deprovisioned". This indicates that the tenant is scheduled for
         deprovisioning, which may take several days to complete.

        You may need to update analytic tenants as they grow and as your organization upgrades the content available to them.
         You may also encounter a scenario where an analytic tenant transitions across different industries. To make updates
         to your tenants, use this API.

         * To ensure that the analytic tenant receives accurate benchmarks and predictive functionality, update their industry code in the Visier system.
         * To programmatically assign the Home analysis that analytic tenants see at login, use this API to set the default Home analysis for a tenant and specific user groups of that tenant.

         You can use this API to update any field on an analytic tenant, except `tenantCode`.

         **Note:** API requests that contain `homeAnalysisId`, `homeAnalysisByUserGroup`, `clickThroughLink`, or
         `defaultCurrency` take longer to run because they require publishing a project to production.

         Before deprovisioning, you must disable an analytic tenant. For more information, see **`/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/disable`**.

         This API removes an analytic tenant permanently from the Visier system. If you are unsure whether an analytic tenant
         may be re-enabled on any of the Visier modules at any time, you may instead want to disable the analytic tenant.

         If successful, the response returns the status "Deprovisioned". This indicates that the tenant is scheduled for
         deprovisioning, which may take several days to complete.

        This API allows you to export the user permission assignments for a tenant. The permission assignments report
         provides a summary of the permissions your users have been assigned and how each permission is being used across
         your user base, as well as the users that do not have any permissions assigned to them.

         Administrating tenant users can export permission assignments for the administrating tenant and the analytic
         tenants those users belong to.

             By default, all events and related objects associated with the analytic object will be inherited from the analytic object in a permission.
             For example, if you assign access to Employee, then access to the Employee Exit event is inherited in the permission.
             To remove access to an event or related object, add the object to `inheritedAccessConfigs` with `removeAccess`: true.
             To add custom filters to an event or related object, add the object to `inheritedAccessConfigs` and define `memberFilterConfigs`.

            Configures the analytic object to inherit population access filters from. The target analytic object must be assigned population access in the permission and have a binding (strong) reference from the source analytic object.
             * For example, assume `Applicant` -> `Requisition` is configured to be a binding (strong) reference.
             For `Applicant` (source analytic object) to inherit population access filters from `Requisition` (target analytic object), in the Applicant `dataSecurityProfile`, set `inheritedReferenceMemberFilterConfig` to `Requisition`. In this example, Applicant will inherit filters from Requisition because Requsition is assigned data security in this permission and there is a binding (strong) reference from Applicant to Requisition.

For example: https://jupiter.visier.com/hr/prod/appcontainer?previewId=-eZPm8xvo3SUMpD4Q5pdE-6mCj9CQ9K699XgqRGwtOxagH5x2IzDFawlWn3hYqFEfU7nP0YK9ASEzmrNfAihGg..&previewType=Production#/analytics/myanalyses/8a4c1d4f-eb61-4da0-9e5b-55bef757c30e.
             The `homeAnalysisID` is 8a4c1d4f-eb61-4da0-9e5b-55bef757c30e.

             Alternatively, retrieve the ID by copying the `contentId` found by following the `Embed a visualization` documentation.
