      summary: Retrieve a list of dimension members
      description: |-
        If you know the ID of a dimension, use this API to retrieve the members of that dimension specifically. You must
         also know the analytic object's ID. Dimension members exist in a hierarchy. The levels in the hierarchy may be
         fixed or non-uniform. Leveled dimensions have fixed hierarchies, while parent-child dimensions have non-uniform
         levels. When you retrieve dimension members with this API, the response returns the level of the dimension and the
         path to get to that level. For example, in a Location dimension, Vancouver is 3 levels deep:

         - All > Canada > British Columbia > Vancouver

         Parent-child hierarchies are non-uniform and exhibit distinct characteristics such as time dependence and data
         attributes. These traits reflect the dynamic nature of hierarchies, for example, organizational hierarchies. The API
         response includes elements that express the validity ranges for retrieved members.

         To specify the tenant in which to update a property, administrating tenants can provide an analytic tenant code in the `TargetTenantID` request header or `tenantCode` for each property in the request body.
         To specify the project in which to update properties, provide a project UUID in the `ProjectID` request header or `projectId` for each property in the request body.

        Member filter values are discrete member references in a dimension filter. You can define

         America” and exclude “Brazil” which results in the metric being evaluated for all South American
         countries except Brazil.
