      summary: Start the data load for analytic tenants
      description: |-
        This API starts the data load process for all analytic tenants included in the specified data files uploaded
         to the Visier SFTP server. On success, you receive a job ID that can be filtered and searched for within the
         Jobs room in Visier. This job ID is associated with the receiving job, and related to all processing jobs that
         spawn for each analytic tenant.

         With the job ID, you can also call the next two APIs to retrieve the status of the receiving job and the status
         list of all related processing jobs.

         **Prerequisite:** You must first obtain Visier's public encryption key and upload the source data files to Visier's
         SFTP server. Files must have a .zip.gpg extension, meaning the files are encrypted using the PGP protocol and compressed.

         Visier provides SFTP server credentials and instructions. You can find the encryption key at https://www.visier.com/pgp/visier.public.pgp.asc.
         After downloading the file, open the file in a text editor or by dragging it into your browser.

         **Note:**
          - To see the full status of all analytic tenant data loads, navigate to the Jobs room in a project.
          - For performance and efficiency, Visier requires that the uncompressed batch file size is below 5 GB and that no
            more than 5000 tenants are included in a batch.

      summary: Transfer data to sources via file upload
      description: |-
        Upload data to Visier as CSV or ZIP files. Each request transfers a single file. If the
         data intended for Visier is stored in multiple files, you may compress them into a single ZIP file or make
         multiple requests within the same transfer session.

         File size limit: 3 GB

         Each file is identified by a sequence number. Sequence numbers help identify any batches that were delivered incorrectly.

         If you define a specific source in the request, all files within the request will target the declared source. If
         a source is not defined, the filenames are matched against the source regex to correctly assign each file to a
         source. To find out the source regex, please contact Visier Customer Success.

         **Note:** If you include files that should target multiple sources in one ZIP file, do not define a source in the request.

         Analytic tenants: For optimal transfer speed, provide one ZIP file per source.
         Administrating tenants: For optimal transfer speed, provide one ZIP file containing all the required data files for your analytic tenants.
         In the ZIP file, use one folder per analytic tenant. The ZIP file must adhere to the following file structure:

         File1.zip
         - Folder1: WFF_tenantCode1

        Send a file to Visier to modify a plan's data. The file must be in CSV format and match the plan's schema. To get the plan's schema, call `GET /v1alpha/planning/model/plans/{id}?withSchema=true`.
        The data file must contain the following columns:
          - `periodId`: From the GET response, use the `date` values in the `timePeriods` array as values in this column.
          - A column for each `id` value in the `planSegmentLevels` object, where the row value is the `id` of the `members` in the `planSegmentLevelMembers` object.
          - A column for each  `id` value in the `planItems` object that you want to modify data for, where the row value is the data value.

For example, to add a new organization under Product, use 3 columns: Organization_Hierarchy.Level_1, Organization_Hierarchy.Level_2, Organization_Hierarchy.Level_3 with 3 segment member values: [Organization_Hierarchy].[Bluesphere], [Organization_Hierarchy].[Product], New Organization. \n    - If the segment member does not exist, write its display name.\n    - If the segment member exists, use its `planSegmentLevelMembers` ID. For example, if your plan is segmented by Organization Hierarchy and Location and you want to add a location under your new organization, you would use the columns  Organization_Hierarchy.Level_1, Organization_Hierarchy.Level_2, Organization_Hierarchy.Level_3, Location.Location_1 with the following values: [Organization_Hierarchy].[Bluesphere], [Organization_Hierarchy].[Product], New Organization, [Location].[North America].[United States].\n  - If removing rows, use one column per plan segment level `segmentId`, where the values are the plan segment levels `id`.

      Use the Direct Data Intake API to load data directly into Visier objects. These objects can be delivered as part of Visier Blueprint, locally modified objects, or even completely custom objects. Objects must be released to production to receive data through the DDI API.
      You can load data into:
      - Subjects
      - Events
      - Parent-child dimensions
      - Multi-value properties

      Send raw or untransformed data to Visier. After we receive the data, Visier runs business rules to transform your data into the expected format for the existing mappings.

      The Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Key API generates key pairs and provides a public key to encrypt data that you send to Visier. PGP encryption adds an additional layer of security against data disclosure.
      <br><br>After you generate a key pair and retrieve the public encryption key, you can encrypt your data files before sending them to Visier. When Visier receives files encrypted with the public key, we retrieve the associated private key to decrypt and process the file.
