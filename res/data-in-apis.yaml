      summary: Transfer data to sources via file upload
      description: |-
        Upload data to Visier as CSV or ZIP files. Each request transfers a single file. If the
         data intended for Visier is stored in multiple files, you may compress them into a single ZIP file or make
         multiple requests within the same transfer session.

         File size limit: 3 GB

         Each file is identified by a sequence number. Sequence numbers help identify any batches that were delivered incorrectly.

         If you define a specific source in the request, all files within the request will target the declared source. If
         a source is not defined, the filenames are matched against the source regex to correctly assign each file to a
         source. To find out the source regex, please contact Visier Customer Success.

         **Note:** If you include files that should target multiple sources in one ZIP file, do not define a source in the request.

         Analytic tenants: For optimal transfer speed, provide one ZIP file per source.
         Administrating tenants: For optimal transfer speed, provide one ZIP file containing all the required data files for your analytic tenants.
         In the ZIP file, use one folder per analytic tenant. The ZIP file must adhere to the following file structure:

         File1.zip
         - Folder1: WFF_tenantCode1
            - Filename1.csv

      description: |-
        This API starts the data load process for all analytic tenants included in the specified data files uploaded
         to the Visier SFTP server. On success, you receive a job ID that can be filtered and searched for within the
         Jobs room in Visier. This job ID is associated with the receiving job, and related to all processing jobs that
         spawn for each analytic tenant.

         With the job ID, you can also call the next two APIs to retrieve the status of the receiving job and the status
         list of all related processing jobs.

         **Prerequisite:** You must first obtain Visier's public encryption key and upload the source data files to Visier's
         SFTP server. Files must have a .zip.gpg extension, meaning the files are encrypted using the PGP protocol and compressed.

         Visier provides SFTP server credentials and instructions. You can find the encryption key at https://www.visier.com/pgp/visier.public.pgp.asc.
         After downloading the file, open the file in a text editor or by dragging it into your browser.

         **Note:**
          - To see the full status of all analytic tenant data loads, navigate to the Jobs room in a project.
          - For performance and efficiency, Visier requires that the uncompressed batch file size is below 5 GB and that no
            more than 5000 tenants are included in a batch.
