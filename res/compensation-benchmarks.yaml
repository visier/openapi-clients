    Discover dimensions and members.
    
    A dimension organizes unique values of an attribute into a list or a hierarchical structure of members. 
    The structure can be navigated to discover the members, and the members can be used to look up benchmark values.

          To get the top-level members, use the value `root`.

          Member availability and the parent-child relationship depends on the selected hierarchy. Please refer to the `hierarchy` parameter.
