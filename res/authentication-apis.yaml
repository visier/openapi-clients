      description: 'The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).'

    description: |-
      To use Visier's public APIs, you must first authenticate yourself as a Visier user who is allowed to use Visier APIs.
      With basic authentication, use your username and password to request a secure token.
      The response returns an ASID token that you can use in your API calls.
