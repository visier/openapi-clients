        Use this API to check the current overall status of Visier's systems.

         The overall status is one of:
         * ``UP`` : All systems are operational.
         * `DOWN`: At least one system is not fully operational.

         **Note:** This API is in **alpha**. While in alpha, APIs may change in a breaking way without notice; functionality may be removed, and no deprecation notices will be issued.
         If you are interested in using this API, please contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM).

      description: 'The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).'
