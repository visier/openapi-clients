        You may need to update analytic tenants as they grow and as your organization upgrades the content available to
         them. You may also encounter a scenario where an analytic tenant transitions across different industries.

         To ensure that the analytic tenant receives accurate benchmarks and predictive functionality, update their
         industry code in the Visier system.

         You can use this API to update any field on an analytic tenant, except `tenantCode`.

        Warning! Deprovisioning an analytic tenant is not reversible.
         Before deprovisioning, you must disable an analytic tenant. For more information, see **`/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/disable`**.

         This API removes an analytic tenant permanently from the Visier system. If you are unsure whether an analytic tenant
         may be re-enabled on any of the Visier modules at any time, you may instead want to disable the analytic tenant.

         If successful, the response returns the status "Deprovisioned". This indicates that the tenant is scheduled for
         deprovisioning, which may take several days to complete.

      description: |-
        If you know the ID of a dimension, use this API to retrieve the members of that dimension specifically. You must
         also know the analytic object's ID. Dimension members exist in a hierarchy. The levels in the hierarchy may be
         fixed or non-uniform. Leveled dimensions have fixed hierarchies, while parent-child dimensions have non-uniform
         levels. When you retrieve dimension members with this API, the response returns the level of the dimension and the
         path to get to that level. For example, in a Location dimension, Vancouver is 3 levels deep:

         - All > Canada > British Columbia > Vancouver

         Parent-child hierarchies are non-uniform and exhibit distinct characteristics such as time dependence and data
         attributes. These traits reflect the dynamic nature of hierarchies, for example, organizational hierarchies. The API
         response includes elements that express the validity ranges for retrieved members.

        Update existing properties by replacing their entire definition. The definition in your API call replaces the property's prior definition. You must provide the entire definition in the PUT call. If you omit values from the update request, those values are removed from the property. We recommend that you retrieve a property's details before you update the property with new values. This operation does not create new properties if they do not exist.
         In each API request, update up to 10 properties per tenant with a maximum of 500 tenants.
         To specify the tenant in which to update a property, administrating tenants can provide an analytic tenant code in the `TargetTenantID` request header or `tenantCode` for each property in the request body.
         To specify the project in which to update properties, provide a project UUID in the `ProjectID` request header or `projectId` for each property in the request body.

      summary: Query a series of detailed snapshots
      description: |-
        To retrieve a collection of `list` query-style snapshots taken at the defined intervals, execute a `snapshot` query.
         Each snapshot in the result is associated with a timestamp, or the "effective date" at which date snapshot data was valid.
         This API allows you to request a detailed time series from Visier.

         Structurally, a `snapshot` query is similar to a `list` query, but has the following differences:
         * The `snapshot` query may contain a column, `effectiveDateProperty`, that specifies the time for each snapshot. To include the `effectiveDateProperty` column, add the following object to the columns array:
            ```json
            {
                "columnName": "Snapshot_Date",
                "columnDefinition": {
                    "effectiveDateProperty": {}
                }
            }
            ```
         * The `snapshot` query uses `timeIntervals` (like an `aggregate` query) instead of `timeInterval` (like a `list` query) because the `snapshot` query
            must specify the number of snapshots to generate. To specify the number of snapshots to generate, use the `intervalCount` property in the `timeIntervals` object, as shown next.
            ```json
            {
                "timeIntervals": {
                "fromDateTime": "2022-01-01",
                "intervalPeriodType": "MONTH",
                "intervalPeriodCount": 6,
                "intervalCount": 4
            }

      summary: Query aggregate or list data using SQL-like syntax
      description: |-
        To retrieve a list of values for specific objects or aggregate values from metrics, you can write queries using SQL-like syntax.
         The response format matches the query type whether aggregate or list. If requested, aggregate query results may be flattened into tabular format.

         A SQL-like query is an aggregate if it contains at least one metric. Aggregate queries must specify a time interval divided into periods; for example:
         ```sql
         SELECT
           employeeCount() AS "Employee Count",
           level(Gender, "Gender") AS Gender
         FROM
           Employee
         WHERE
          Visier_Time IN periods(date("2023-01-01"), 4, period(3, Month));
         ```

         A SQL-like query is a list if it does not contain any metrics. List queries define time intervals as simple intervals; for example:
         ```sql
         SELECT
           EmployeeID AS "Employee ID",
           level(Gender, "Gender") AS Gender
         FROM
           Employee
         WHERE
          Visier_Time BETWEEN date("2022-01-01") AND date("2023-01-01");

      summary: Start the data load for analytic tenants
      description: |-
        This API starts the data load process for all analytic tenants included in the specified data files uploaded
         to the Visier SFTP server. On success, you receive a job ID that can be filtered and searched for within the
         Jobs room in Visier. This job ID is associated with the receiving job, and related to all processing jobs that
         spawn for each analytic tenant.

         With the job ID, you can also call the next two APIs to retrieve the status of the receiving job and the status
         list of all related processing jobs.

         **Prerequisite:** You must first obtain Visier's public encryption key and upload the source data files to Visier's
         SFTP server. Files must have a .zip.gpg extension, meaning the files are encrypted using the PGP protocol and compressed.

         Visier provides SFTP server credentials and instructions. You can find the encryption key at https://www.visier.com/pgp/visier.public.pgp.asc.
         After downloading the file, open the file in a text editor or by dragging it into your browser.

         **Note:**
          - To see the full status of all analytic tenant data loads, navigate to the Jobs room in a project.
          - For performance and efficiency, Visier requires that the uncompressed batch file size is below 5 GB and that no
            more than 5000 tenants are included in a batch.

      summary: Update an analytic tenant
      description: |-
        You may need to update analytic tenants as they grow and as your organization upgrades the content available to them.
         You may also encounter a scenario where an analytic tenant transitions across different industries. To make updates
         to your tenants, use this API.

         * To ensure that the analytic tenant receives accurate benchmarks and predictive functionality, update their industry code in the Visier system.
         * To programmatically assign the Home analysis that analytic tenants see at login, use this API to set the default Home analysis for a tenant and specific user groups of that tenant.

         You can use this API to update any field on an analytic tenant, except `tenantCode`.

         **Note:** API requests that contain `homeAnalysisId`, `homeAnalysisByUserGroup`, `clickThroughLink`, or
         `defaultCurrency` take longer to run because they require publishing a project to production.

         Before deprovisioning, you must disable an analytic tenant. For more information, see **`/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}/disable`**.

         This API removes an analytic tenant permanently from the Visier system. If you are unsure whether an analytic tenant
         may be re-enabled on any of the Visier modules at any time, you may instead want to disable the analytic tenant.

         If successful, the response returns the status "Deprovisioned". This indicates that the tenant is scheduled for
         deprovisioning, which may take several days to complete.

      summary: Transfer data to sources via file upload
      description: |-
        Upload data to Visier as CSV or ZIP files. Each request transfers a single file. If the
         data intended for Visier is stored in multiple files, you may compress them into a single ZIP file or make
         multiple requests within the same transfer session.

         File size limit: 3 GB

         Each file is identified by a sequence number. Sequence numbers help identify any batches that were delivered incorrectly.

         If you define a specific source in the request, all files within the request will target the declared source. If
         a source is not defined, the filenames are matched against the source regex to correctly assign each file to a
         source. To find out the source regex, please contact Visier Customer Success.

         **Note:** If you include files that should target multiple sources in one ZIP file, do not define a source in the request.

         Analytic tenants: For optimal transfer speed, provide one ZIP file per source.
         Administrating tenants: For optimal transfer speed, provide one ZIP file containing all the required data files for your analytic tenants.
         In the ZIP file, use one folder per analytic tenant. The ZIP file must adhere to the following file structure:

         File1.zip
         - Folder1: WFF_tenantCode1

        Member filter values are discrete member references in a dimension filter. You can define
         included and excluded members simultaneously. This is typically done with filtering applied on
         dimensions with multiple levels. For example, a Location parameter may include “South
         America” and exclude “Brazil” which results in the metric being evaluated for all South American
         countries except Brazil.

             For example, consider a multi-metric query that contains metrics that count the number of applicants and requisitions,
             grouped by the country of the recruiter's direct manager. The following sample shows how to use qualifyingPath to specify
             the object reference traversal path from each metric's convergent analytic object to the start of the path for the axes.
             In this example, there is only one convergent analytic object.

             * `DEFAULT`: The default member name representation. For non-time members, this returns the technical member name path.
               For time members, this includes a bracketed member index.
               For example, Time instant member: `2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z - [0]`
               For example, Time interval member: `2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z/2022-07-01T00:00:00.000Z - [12]`
             * `COMPACT`: Shortens the member name representation. For time intervals, the member name is the end time of the interval.
                For example, Time instant member: `2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z`
                For example, Time interval member: `2022-07-01T00:00:00.000Z` where the interval member name was `2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z/2022-07-01T00:00:00.000Z - [12]`
             * `DISPLAY`: Emits the members' display names whenever possible. When combined with `axisVisibility = VERBOSE`, the full display name path will be emitted.
             * `MDX`: Emits member name paths where each element is enclosed in square brackets, `[]`. Multidimensional expression (MDX) display mode automatically encloses time members in square brackets and puts them in `COMPACT` format.
               For example, Location member `North America.United States.California` becomes `[North America].[United States].[California]` in MDX display mode.
               For example, Time instant member `2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z - [0]` becomes `[2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z]` in MDX display mode.
             * `COMPACT_DISPLAY`: Emit the members' display names after compacting. This applies primarily to time members for event-based metrics. Compact display is required when
               running multi-metric queries containing both event-based and subject-based metrics. Multi-metric queries with `DISPLAY` mode are changed
               automatically to `COMPACT_DISPLAY`.
               For example, Time interval member `2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z/2022-07-01T00:00:00.000Z - [12]` becomes `Jun 30, 2022` in `COMPACT_DISPLAY` mode.
               The exact format of the compacted time member display name depends on the the user's locale.

Both options determine the date using the request's `source` field. Whether the source is a metric, formula, or metrics, each source has earliest and latest data available dates to use. The `direction` determines whether the earliest or latest date is used.\n\n * If `dynamicDateFrom` is `SOURCE`, the query returns data from a date determined by the `source` query definition element.
