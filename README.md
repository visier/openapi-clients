## Overview
Visier, Inc. publishes the [OpenAPI v3](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) definitions of a growing list of its public APIs to ease the development of client applications against the Visier platform. OpenAPI v3 is a language-agnostic definition, enabling (among other things) the programmatic generation of client-level interface wrappers that substantially reduce the amount of code that has to otherwise be written manually in libraries or directly in applications.

Presently, OpenAPI v3 definitions are available of Visier's Authentication APIs as well as Query and Data Model APIs.

## Usage
At present time, only the OpenAPI v3 definitions are published; at present time, Visier does not publish additional libraries and samples that are geared towards a particular kind of wrapper. 

Developers are required to generate the API wrappers using a tool of their choice and then write their application to make Visier public API calls using these wrappers.

OpenAPI v3 client-wrappers can be generated using freely available tools as well as using commercially supported options.
